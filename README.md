# Conway's Game of Life

This is a python implementation of Conway's game of life, a cellular automaton devised by the British Mathematician John Conway. The game simulates the life and death of cells on a grid according to a set of simple rules.

## Rules:

- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies (underpopulation).
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies (overpopulation).
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell (reproduction).

## Controls:

- Left-click: Toggle the state of a cell (alive or dead).
- Spacebar: Start or pause the simulation.
- C key: Clear the grid and pause the simulation.
- X key: Generate a random population of live cells.
